                  substances designed to enhance the immune response of vaccines

                Adjuvants are capable of boosting immune response by a
                combination of various mechanisms, including (1){" "}
                <b>sustained release of antigen</b> at the site of injection
                (depot effect), (2) <b>up-regulation of cytokines</b> and
                chemokines, (3) <b>cellular recruitment</b> at the site of
                injection, (4) <b>increase antigen uptake</b> and presentation
                to antigen-presenting cells (APC), (5){" "}
                <b>activation and maturation of APC</b> [increased major
                histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and co-stimulatory
                molecules expression] and migration to the draining lymph nodes,
                and (6) <b>activation of inflammasomes</b>. It seems that
                adjuvants activate innate immune responses to create a local
                immuno-competent environment at the injection site. Depending on
                the type of innate responses activated, adjuvants can alter the
                quality and quantity of adaptive immune responses [22].
