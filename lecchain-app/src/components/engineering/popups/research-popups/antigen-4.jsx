                Our subunitary vaccine against SARS-Cov-2 must contain a domain

                structural information from the virus. Of all covid-19 antigens,
                spike (S) protein can bind to the endogenous receptor to attach,
                fusion, and enter into host cells.

                RBD is a good candidate for the antigen due to its simple

                neutralizing monoclonal antibody titers in serum and is related
