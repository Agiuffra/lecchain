                Our subunitary vaccine against SARS-Cov-2 must contain a domain
                of virus to generate a human immune response. So we had to get
                structural information from the virus. Of all covid-19 antigens,
                spike (S) protein can bind to the endogenous receptor to attach,
                fusion, and enter into host cells.

                We found some properties of SARS-CoV2 RBD:

                    <div>-</div>
                    RBD is an antigen located in the S1 subunit in S protein.
                    because it can bind strongly to the human
                    angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate a key role
                    in viral entry [2], [26].

                    <div>-</div>
                    RBD generates neutralizing antibodies (NAb) that bind
                    directly to the RBD and compete with the cellular receptor,
                    ACE2, resulting in neutralization of viral infection and
                    clearance of the virus [27], [28]. Even in infected
                    patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies can bind distinct
                    domains on the RBD and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [29]. It was
                    identified that neutralizing RBD antibodies like S2H97 could
                    bind to several SARS-CoV2 strains [30].

                    It is reported that RBD was expressed in Escherichia coli.
                    By applying circular dichroism, fluorescence and
                    Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy techniques,
                    conformational structure was almost unaltered. Even RBD
                    produced in E coli did not have glycosylation, its secondary
                    and tertiary structure was maintained and capable of
                    strongly binding human ACE2. [2], [26].

                RBD is a good candidate for the antigen due to its simple
                structure capable of being expressed in a recombinant bacterial
                system. It has shown stimulation of the production of high
                neutralizing monoclonal antibody titers in serum and is related
                to enhancing vaccine immunogenicity.
