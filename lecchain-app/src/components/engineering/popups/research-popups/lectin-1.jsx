                After choosing the antigen of the SARS-COV-2 virus, the main
                problem of current subunitary vaccines remains to be the
                distribution to hard-to-reach regions of the country. In that
                sense, we start investigating ways to{" "}
                <b>distribute vaccines without cold chains</b>. We found
                <b>
                  thermotolerant proteins remain soluble despite receiving heat
                  treatment

                . They do not denature or lose their biological activity. In one
                investigation, Kwon et al. [33] gave heat-treatment, from 20 째C
                to 85 째C and back to 20 째C, to <b>E. coli proteins</b> and
                proposed a general classification of the obtained heat-stable
                proteins into three classes. The first class corresponds to
                <b>
                  proteins that remain in their native and soluble state upon
                  heating

                . The second class of heat-stable proteins{" "}
                <b>unfolds upon heating</b>, but their{" "}
                <b>unfolded form is soluble in water</b>. The third class of
                heat-stable proteins is <b>unfolded by heating</b> but can be
                <b>refolded to their native state when cooled down</b>.

                We found proteins from Archaea can conserve their native folding
                <b>at temperatures higher than 100째C</b> and improve the
                <b>thermostability of the passengers</b> to which they are
                fused. Fusing a thermostable protein to a passenger can cause
                two scenarios. The passenger <b>stabilizes the whole fusion</b>{" "}

                We discovered that many proteins had demonstrated thermostable
                properties when fused with a passenger protein. In the following
                table, we summarized some of them.
