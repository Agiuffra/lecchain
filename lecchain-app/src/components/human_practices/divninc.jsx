            <b> Accessibility to scientific information is usually limited by the 
            barriers that some groups of the population cross </b> (i.e. <b> languages, 
            hearing, motor or visual impairment</b>). In that sense, <b> Lecchain </b> seeks 
            to provide support to these groups as part of our project by 
            developing <b> small initiatives that recognize the importance of them 
            in our scientific community</b>. Despite multiple affected groups of 
            people in Peru, we start guiding our initiatives to <b> native 
            indigenous languages (Quechua), people with visual, motor or physical 
            disabilities.</b>

            Although <b> Lecchain </b> seeks to be the first step for thermostable vaccines 
            and thus be <b> accessible to remote areas</b>, the <b> information we provide can 
            be a challenge because of the different native language that is spoken 
            in the country</b>. For instance, Quechua is spoken in seven different 
            countries by a population that is often forgotten. Only in Peru there 
            are more than <b> 3 million quechua-speaking people and only 205 official 
            translators</b>. Thus, by not having enough resources to allow them 
            research and learn more about science in their language, that could 
            generate distrust in science. Just like that, nowadays, <b> since the 
            COVID19 outbreak took place in the country, the indigenous communities 
            did not have a direct contact with the scientifics updatings </b> and 
            currently <b> there exists a problem with the vaccination of the 
            indigenous people because there are no doctors who are able to 
            communicate with them </b> and that is delaying the immunization in 
            those areas. Although the government is trying to begin the 
            communication, the progress is going slow due to the small number 
            of translators. That is the reason, with <b> Lecchain </b> the objective is 
            not only for our product to reach rural areas, but also for the 
            dissemination of scientific knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this in mind, <b> Lecchain makes available a web-page version all 
            in Quechua thanks to the help of official translators from Peru</b>. 
            Moreover, <b> our promotional video has in it an official quechua 
            translation</b>. Having taken this first step, we will <b> continue having 
            all our audiovisual content available in this language </b> in order to 
            involve the Peruvian community in our project and in science.

            One of the key places to learn more about science, without a doubt, 
            are <b> laboratories</b>. This is the place where “magic” comes true, where 
            you <b> can experiment with living hands and expand your imagination

            find barriers to go through</b>. How can we ensure to find the 
            appropriate way so they feel comfortable and secure to develop their

            <b> Lecchain </b> has developed a <b> “Survival Guide” </b> to <b> make laboratories 
            accessible for everyone</b>. It shows general recommendations regarding 
            specific groups. With this, we hope to <b> call the actions of 
            universities </b> and start thinking about these groups by applying the 
            <b> appropriate recommendations and guidelines. Involving everyone, no 
            matter what, into science, has to be a must for every educational 
            </b>. The complete “Survival Guide'' is found in the additional

            In the National Population Census of 2017, more than <b> 230 
            thousand people with hearing disabilities were registered in 
            Peru (INEI-2017)</b>. Although there is no exact number of people 
            who communicate through the <b> Peruvian Sign Language (LSP, in 
            Spanish), the Ombudsman’s Office of Peru receives a persistent 
            number of complaints indicating the barriers they face in various

            Office, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            As a way to include this group of people in the science community, 
            <b> Lecchain </b> implement a <b> peruvian sign language interpreter in our 
            audiovisual content</b>. We believe this little step will give them 
            the <b> opportunity to start being included in the science community</b>. 
            Additionally, it will serve as an <b> example for other science groups </b>
            to start including all group of people.

            In Peru there are <b> 801 thousand people who present visual disabilities</b>. 
            However, with COVID-19 pandemic, <b> usual problems began to be around 
            virtuality</b>. Actually, there is a <b> huge barrier regarding blind people 
            and web pages</b>. Most of the times, this group of people used to <b> read 
            through an application that works as a “screen reader”</b>. However, the 
            majority of <b> web pages are not designed for these applications</b>, making 
            difficult for them to understand what is written. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Lecchain looks to <b> adapt its web page </b> to be <b> more inclusive to this 
            group of people</b>. In that sense, we develop <b> some interviews with 
            blindness organizations </b> to understand what <b> problems </b> they used to 
            <b> experience when they visit a web page </b>. Some of them are listed below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There are <b> not enough colors on the website </b> and this is important 
              because it serves as a point of reference for those with <b> low 
              vision and/or partial blindness</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Advertisements or graphics with movements </b> used to blur the reader.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some <b> photos do not have alternative texts </b> to describe what is showing. 
              Screen readers cannot read photos unless it has a brief description. 
            </li>
            <li>
              A not minor detail is to <b> include a change in contrast, size and 
              color in the webpage</b>. This could make it easier for the application 
              to understand some words.
            </li>
            <li>
              In <b> videos</b>, add <b> a script that describes the images </b> and sounds that 
              are presented. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Some of these recommendations </b> were <b> implemented on the webpage</b>. However, 
            we are <b> still improving it to include all of them</b>. Meeting and focus group 
            with blind people will be organized to receive feedback regarding our
