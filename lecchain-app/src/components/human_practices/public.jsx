            The year 2021 marked a new stage in the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. 
            Thanks to the efforts of many scientists, vaccination programs 
            to prevent COVID-19 started relatively quickly. However, the 
            situation in developing countries such as Peru presented huge 
            challenges related to <b> complex cold chain logistics </b> and <b> public 
            distrust of vaccines</b>. To put this in context, the Peruvian 
            country went through a major corruption scandal in the purchase 
            of vaccines, which caused many people to feel <b> distrustful and 
            unwilling to get vaccinated</b>. In this sense, <b> Lecchain had a strong 
            commitment to inform about the importance of vaccines and promote 
            synthetic biology </b> as a tool to <b> generate solutions that benefit 
            public health</b>. Simultaneously, we have been presenting our 
            proposal through various media and activities, with the objective 
            that more people feel involved in the ideation process. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In this way, we strive to include different target audiences, 
            allowing people of all ages to become familiar with the most 
            important concepts related to vaccines and the world of 
            synthetic biology. We are happy to have organized and 
            participated in initiatives that have contributed to reducing 
            the gap of <b> mistrust in vaccination programs </b> and <b> sowing hope 
            that Lecchain will become a reality very soon</b>.

          Our alliance with Piso 11 was evidenced through various

          they conducted with us, which was shared through their official 
          website. In that interview, we mentioned that <b> Lecchain </b> was 
          competing in the <b> iGEM Design League </b>, a competition designed to 
          support synthetic biology experiments. We also shared that we 
          have received different training and tools to improve our

          What we did next was to participate in instagram stories on
          <b> @revistapiso11</b>. The objective was to answer questions from 
          the public about vaccines. Many of these questions were about 
          whether the vaccines were safe, what was their manufacturing 
          process or why it was necessary to get vaccinated. This activity 
          was <b> really important </b> because it made us realize that people are 
          still a bit suspicious about vaccination, so we thought it was 
          interesting to expand this segment and turn this question and 
          answer dynamic into podcasts. See the note of Piso 11

          the aim of clarifying the doubts of the population about 
          vaccines. Although in all the podcasts we used colloquial language,

          There were a total of five podcasts that were uploaded

          What do cold chains consist of? Those were some of the 
          questions that we solved through our publications. In 
          addition, we fought <b> against misinformation </b> about certain 
          vaccines; and we talked about how it would be good to keep

          A "Vacunaton" is a marathon vaccination created by Peruvian 
          authorities that lasts 36 consecutive hours, usually held 
          on weekends. This event was very popular at first, but then 
          people became discouraged due to the strong anti-vaccine 
          propaganda promoted by certain groups in Peru. So, we thought 
          it was a good idea to go to these vaccination centers to 
          <b> interview people </b> and get their perspective on the vaccination 
          programs, <b> solve </b> some <b> doubts </b> and ask them about what they think 
          regarding the <b> solution designed by Lecchain</b>.

          To maintain social distancing, responses were written on 
          sticky notes and then posted on a whiteboard. This process 
          was valuable because it allowed us to empathize with the 
          <b> citizen's perspectives</b>. In general, people expected 
          vaccination centres to diversify not only in hospitals, 
          but also in pharmacies or shopping malls. It is at this 
          point that we realized that although <b> Lecchain </b> was designed
